# Do you want the player to regain health when saturated?

# Do you want to change the food level to change for a player?
# This can be set to true (by default), or false, if you don't want the player to lose any food levels (still can regain it thorugh eating, though)

# 
# If you don't want to have any effects on a food, type in none
#
# The effects have to be structured like this:
# [potiontype, probability, duration, strength]
# You don't have to include all parameters, but the order is crucial:
# [] -> Nothing happens
# [1] -> Speed potion, 100% chance, 30 sec, strength 1
# [2, 78%] -> Slowness potion, 78% chance, 30 sec, strength 1
# [3, 78%, 10] -> Potion of haste, 78% chance, 10 sec, strength 1
# [4, 78%, 10, 3] -> Slow Digging potion, 78% chance, 10 sec, strength 3
#
# You can also add multiple effects using the semicolon:
# [10; 12, 14%; 17, 100%, 10, 5] -> Regeneration effect for 30 sec, a 14% chance of getting fire resistance for 30 sec and Hunger for 10 sec with the strength of 5
